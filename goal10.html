        <h2>Current Challenges to Achieving SDG 10</h2>
        <p>Despite progress, significant challenges remain:</p>
        <ul>

            <li><strong>Discrimination and Marginalization</strong>: Structural inequalities based on gender, race, ethnicity, and disability hinder equal opportunities for many individuals.</li>
            <li><strong>Limited Access to Resources</strong>: Lack of access to education, healthcare, and financial services perpetuates cycles of poverty and inequality.</li>
            <li><strong>Political Instability</strong>: Conflict and political instability can exacerbate inequalities, particularly in vulnerable regions and communities.</li>
            <li><strong>Global Crises</strong>: Economic downturns, natural disasters, and health pandemics, such as COVID-19, disproportionately impact marginalized groups, further widening existing inequalities.</li>
