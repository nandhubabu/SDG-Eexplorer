        <h2>Current Challenges to Achieving SDG 8</h2>
        <p>Despite progress, significant challenges remain:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Unemployment and Underemployment</strong>: Many people, particularly youth, face high unemployment rates or are stuck in low-quality jobs.</li>
            <li><strong>Informal Employment</strong>: A large portion of the workforce is engaged in informal employment, lacking protections and benefits associated with formal jobs.</li>
            <li><strong>Inequality in the Labor Market</strong>: Gender, racial, and economic inequalities persist in the labor market, limiting opportunities for many individuals.</li>
            <li><strong>Economic Disruption</strong>: Global crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have significantly disrupted economies, leading to job losses and increased poverty.</li>
            <li><strong>Technological Disruption</strong>: Rapid technological advancements can lead to job displacement, particularly for low-skilled workers, exacerbating inequality.</li>
        </ul>
